## Description
Enhance the option fetcher with more sophisticated option selection methods and additional strategy types to provide more flexibility and control over option selection.

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Additional Strategy Types
- [ ] Iron Condor
- [ ] Butterfly Spread
- [ ] Calendar Spread
- [ ] Straddle/Strangle
- [ ] Ratio Spread
- [ ] Back Spread

### 2. Advanced Option Selection Methods
- [ ] Find options by Greeks:
  - [ ] Gamma-based selection
  - [ ] Theta-based selection
  - [ ] Vega-based selection
  - [ ] Rho-based selection
- [ ] Find options by implied volatility:
  - [ ] IV percentile
  - [ ] IV rank
  - [ ] IV skew
- [ ] Find options by specific criteria:
  - [ ] Strike price range
  - [ ] Expiry date range
  - [ ] Volume/Open Interest
  - [ ] Bid-Ask spread

### 3. Strategy Builder Improvements
- [ ] Custom strategy builder with multiple legs
- [ ] Risk/reward ratio calculation
- [ ] Probability of profit calculation
- [ ] Maximum loss/profit calculation
- [ ] Break-even points calculation

### 4. Data Quality Improvements
- [ ] Option chain data validation
- [ ] Missing data handling
- [ ] Data freshness checks
- [ ] Historical data comparison

## Implementation Details

### New Methods to Add
```python
def find_option_by_greek(self, chain: pd.DataFrame, target_greek: float, greek_type: str) -> pd.Series:
    """Find option with closest Greek value."""
    pass

def find_option_by_iv(self, chain: pd.DataFrame, target_iv: float, iv_type: str) -> pd.Series:
    """Find option with closest implied volatility."""
    pass

def find_options_in_range(self, chain: pd.DataFrame, 
                         strike_range: Tuple[float, float],
                         expiry_range: Tuple[datetime, datetime]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Find options within specified strike and expiry ranges."""
    pass

def build_custom_strategy(self, legs: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
    """Build custom option strategy with multiple legs."""
    pass
```

### Example Usage
```python
# Find option with specific gamma
option = fetcher.find_option_by_greek(chain, target_gamma=0.1, greek_type='gamma')

# Find option with specific IV percentile
option = fetcher.find_option_by_iv(chain, target_iv=0.3, iv_type='percentile')

# Build iron condor
strategy = fetcher.get_option_strategy_contracts(
    symbol='AAPL',
    strategy_type='iron_condor',
    target_delta=0.3,
    wing_width=5
)
```

## Benefits
1. More flexible option selection based on various criteria
2. Support for complex multi-leg strategies
3. Better risk management through Greeks-based selection
4. Improved data quality and validation
5. Enhanced strategy analysis capabilities

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- yfinance
- scipy (for Greeks calculations)

## Testing Requirements
1. Unit tests for new methods
2. Integration tests for strategy building
3. Edge case handling
4. Performance testing with large option chains
5. Data validation tests

## Documentation Updates
1. Update API documentation
2. Add examples for new methods
3. Add strategy building guide
4. Update README with new features

## Related Issues
- None

## Additional Notes
- Consider adding caching for frequently accessed data
- Add logging for debugging and monitoring
- Consider adding async support for better performance
