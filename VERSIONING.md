# Version Release Plan

This document outlines the version release plan for the Financial Simulation Library, following semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) principles.

## Versioning Scheme

We follow semantic versioning (SemVer) where:
- MAJOR version (X.0.0): Breaking changes
- MINOR version (0.X.0): New features, no breaking changes
- PATCH version (0.0.X): Bug fixes and minor improvements
