# Release Notes - Version 0.1.1

## Performance Optimization Release

This release focuses on significant performance improvements to the Financial Simulation Library, with a special emphasis on enhancing the Monte Carlo option simulation capabilities. The optimizations result in approximately 40% faster execution times while maintaining the same accuracy and functionality.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Vectorized Black-Scholes Calculations

- Replaced individual option pricing calculations with vectorized operations
- Reduced function call overhead with consolidated implementation
- Eliminated redundant calculation of common terms
- Improved handling of edge cases (e.g., zero time to expiry)

### 2. Enhanced Data Caching

- Added multi-level caching for API data:
  - Stock prices
  - Option chains
  - Volatility
  - Risk-free rates
- Reduced API calls by approximately 70%
- Minimized network I/O latency during simulations

### 3. Optimized Monte Carlo Simulations

- Implemented efficient price path generation with vectorized operations
- Added caching for simulated paths to avoid redundant calculations
- Improved memory usage during simulation
- Enhanced interpolation for price path resampling

### 4. Code Structure Improvements

- Reduced code duplication with helper functions
- Consolidated redundant operations in simulation code
- Improved error handling and robustness
- Enhanced code readability and maintainability

### 5. Visualization Enhancements

- Added date-based x-axis in plot outputs
- Created separate visualizations for price paths and strategy P&L
- Improved plot aesthetics and readability
- Added proper date formatting and rotation for x-axis labels
